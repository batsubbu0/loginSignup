# loginSignup
Using  reactjs

this is my first react project where user can do both login sign up.
this project contains only one page.  
in this app user can do both login and sign up.
if user choose sign up the he/she has to fill name,email,password columns.
in login process name column will be hidden from the user and forgot password button displayed right after the 
password column.
if there is any doubt about this project you can dm me on insta @subbu911, gmail-subramanyaprabhu1001@gmail.com
